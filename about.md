<p class="avatar"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/avatar.png" alt="haircut"></p>

I'm Matthew Warren. I'm currently the Apple Systems Administrator at UNC Asheville.

I write about managing Macs using Jamf Pro, Python, and other tools.

This is my personal site, and views expressed here do not necessarily reflect those of my employer.

I'm usually on the [MacAdmins Slack Team](https://macadmins.herokuapp.com/); feel free to [direct message me](https://macadmins.slack.com/messages/D1KK1H0PR/team/U0DH2V3PE/).

You can also find my [projects on GitHub](https://github.com/haircut), and [various snippets on Gist](https://gist.github.com/haircut).

## Generation and Theme

This site is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

The theme is based on [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale/) by Chester How, which I've customized for my preferences.
